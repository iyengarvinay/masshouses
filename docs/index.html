<p>Today, residential real estate private equity and brokerage firms rely on outdated and inefficient tools for valuing their assets. A junior analyst must manually build an Excel model that takes into account several different factors such as the location, the square footage, etc. and then make assumptions about their impact on the pricing of the property. He or she oftentimes will look at comparable properties or “comps” to try to understand how similar properties are priced.  Although such estimates and assumptions are commonly accepted in the industry, there is a large degree of subjectivity in building these models and choosing comps. Incorrect models can lead to real estate private equity firms buying properties at prices that are higher than their intrinsic value which handicaps value to provide returns for their clients e.g. endowments, pension funds, and so on.</p>
<p>The proliferation of datasets on property characteristics through county websites provides promise for an approach that is more rigorous than the assumptions made by a human analyst. We propose a new data science approach that provides a model that real estate private equity firms can use to predict the value of a residential property in Boston. </p>

<a id="cs109-class-project-objectives" class="anchor" href="#cs109-class-project-objectives" aria-hidden="true">
<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Objectives</h3>

<p>Through this project, we sought to answer three primary questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Which features of a home are linked to the intrinsic value of a home? </li>
  <li>Can we integrate those features into a predictive algorithm that would predict the intrinsic value of a property</li>
  <li>What form should that algorithm take?</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a id="cs109-class-project-approach" class="anchor" href="#cs109-class-project-objectives" aria-hidden="true">
<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Approach</h3>

<p>We began our study by scraping a dataset from the City of Boston Assessing Department which is responsible for providing the current value and tax status of properties in the Boston area. The dataset included 169,199 properties and had 77 features. Some features were land and living square footage, number of rooms (bedrooms and bathrooms), building style, year built, and year of latest remodel. We cleaned the data by removing properties with appraisal prices of zero dollars, removed outliers that were likewise illogical (e.g. the year built is 0), and performed one-hot encoding to convert qualitative. Then, we performed several exploratory analyses with the goal of understanding how different variables were associated with one another. The information collected during the data exploration was used to inform the construction of the three predictive models: one using linear regression, one using lasso, and using ridge. </p>

<h2><a id="analysis" class="anchor" href="#cs109-class-project-analysis" aria-hidden="true">
<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Analysis</h2>

<p>The Hubway system serves casual users as well as riders who pay a membership fee to utilize the bicycles more 
regularly. The company collects demographics data on its members. During 2012, about two thirds of Hubway riders were 
members, and of those about three fourths were males. </p>
<img src="images/gender.png" alt="gender">

<p>Hubway is intended for short rides, and overtime fees apply to trips longer than thirty minutes. Our analysis of 
Hubway’s trip data shows that over 90 percent of trips have a duration of less than 30 minutes. </p>
<img src="images/tripduration.png" alt="duration">

<p>Hubway serves both commuters and casual riders. By mapping trip routes for weekdays and weekends, we see that 
certain routes are heavily used on weekdays for commuting. On weekends, when casual riders and tourists constitute 
Hubway’s main user base, trips are more distributed across the system. </p>
<img src="images/tripODs.png" alt="tripODs">

<p>Hubway users almost always ride in a single direction, picking up and dropping off their bikes at different 
stations. A user might retrieve a bike at Central Square and return it at Harvard Square. This behavior leads to 
imbalances in the system: popular origin stations run out of bikes and popular destination stations fill up with 
bikes, running out of return docks. The resulting disparities cause shortages for riders and represent the motivation 
for our study. The bar charts and maps below identify the stations most often empty or full during the weekday morning
 and evening rush hours. </p>
<img src="images/ArrivalsDepartures.png" alt="arrdept">
<img src="images/AMFull.png" alt="amfull">
<img src="images/AMEmpty.png" alt="amempty">
<img src="images/PMFull.png" alt="pmfull">
<img src="images/PMEmpty.png" alt="pmempty">

<p>We used a combingation of singular value decomposition and k-means to identify groups of stations with similar 
usage patterns. For each station, we compute the average value of fullness for every 5-minute interval on weekdays 
and use this result as a feature vector for the clustering process. A fullness of 1 during a given interval indicates 
that a station tends to be totally full during that interval on an average weekday. In the heatmap below, each line 
represents the fullness profile of a single station over the course of a weekday and stations are grouped according to
 cluster membership. The heat map and geographic map below illustrate the results of our clustering effort and clearly
 differentiate between stations primarily serving commuters (clusters 1 and 2) and stations used for mutiple purposes 
 (clusters 3 and 4). Stations in cluster 1 tend to be located in residential areas, explaining why they are mostly 
 full in the morning and evening and empty during the working day. In contrast, stations in cluster 2 tend to be full 
 mosty during midday and empty in the morning and evening. Stations in clusters 3 and 4 tend to line in the periphery 
 of zones covered by clusters 1 and 2. </p>

<p>It’s no fun riding a bike in the rain. These plots show how rain puts a damper in Hubway ridership. The effect is 
more pronounced on weekends, when Hubway users tend to be casual riders who can simply save the trip for another day 
or take a taxi.</p>
<img src="images/Rain.png" alt="rain">

<p>Riding a bike in warm weather is great. Unless it’s too warm. This plot, along with the accompanying LOESS 
regression (green line) depicts ridership as a function of temperature. Ridership peaks when temperatures hit the low 
70s (fahrenheit) but then drops when temperatures become uncomfortably hot. </p>

<p>This plot shows how the number of Hubway trips leaving the stations near Fenway spikes on nights with Red Sox 
games. Go Sox!</p>

<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Prediction</h2>

<p>Below is a table indicating the prediction accuracy of the various models we built along the way. </p>
 <img src="table.jpg" alt="Results">
 
 <p>As this table indicates, our process went from a baseline model with an R2 of 0.18 to a more sophisticated tuned ridge regression model with an R2 of 0.46, to ultimately a tuned lasso model with an R2 of 0.48. Along the way, we tried out every model learned in the class, most of which did not work on our data or produced worse results. Our final model also had an average residual of $187,500, which is comparable to the best models in literature. </p>

<h2><a id="summary" class="anchor" href="#cs109-class-project-prediction" aria-hidden="true">
<span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Summary</h2>

  <p>In conclusion, we were able to build a new model for real estate private equity valuation that proves to be much more efficient and just as accurate as the best models used in industry and literature today. This is a promising first step in the new age of using machine learning and computational tools to make financial analyis better.</p>
